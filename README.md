Landing page project for TOP foundations curriculum 


I am in the process of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through The Odin Project. This is a project from scratch to 
showcase what I have learned thus far.

As a review, this project displays use of HTML & CSS tools such as flexbox, images, links, and accessibility features. More work
to be completed on the overall UX design including color scheme, layout, and functionality.
